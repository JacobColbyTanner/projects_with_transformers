#Note that the initial code used for the transformer model used here comes from a tutorial by Andrej Karpathy

Here, I will be teaching myself how to use transformer models by training transformers to solve a number of sequence problems.

1st: I will be performing next word prediction/generation on Shakespeare task (as in the tutorial above), but I will be changing the embedding from letter embeddings to word or partial word embeddings using different packages

2nd: I will predict the next time step of neural activity by training a transformer on fMRI data.
